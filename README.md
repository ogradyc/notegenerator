# notegenerator
Trying to fork this here because I also have a script that generates files for taking notes. I've had my python script for a little bit, but I haven't posted to Git hub till now because I'm looking to get a better official change log going while I try to make this script available to be used by a wider audience. If this is not the appropriate use of a fork, let me know and I'll fix it, but I do fully intend to compare my script with the other one to see if I can glean more ideas on the same concept. 

Python script which uses a template and scrapes data from other systems to populate order-specific data in the variable fields within the template. This then generates a plain-text document and local folder structure that can be used at a starting point for research and notes about an order. This program aims to help streamline and automate some of the repetitive research steps. 

Input: template 
[noteGenerator scrapes data and populates template variables] 
Output: Plain-text document, local folder structure and other attachments or relevant files related to an order.
